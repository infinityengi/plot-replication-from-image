# Plot Replication from Image

This project demonstrates how to digitize and replicate a research plot from an image using Python.

## Folders
- `data/`: Contains original plot images.
- `digitized_data/`: CSV files extracted using WebPlotDigitizer.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and plotting.

## Instructions
1. Use WebPlotDigitizer to extract data points from the image.
2. Save data in `digitized_data/`.
3. Use code in `notebooks/` or `replicate_plot.py` to regenerate the plot.

## Requirements
- matplotlib
- pandas
- jupyter
